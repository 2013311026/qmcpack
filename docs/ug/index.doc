/*! \mainpage User Guide

This guide is not meant to discuss Quantum Monte Carlo methods and is
written on the assumption that the users are familiar with various QMC
algorithms. There are many excellent tutorials and talks on QMC methods
and numerous published works. A short list includes

\section start_sec Getting and building QMCPACK

Consult wiki for the updated instructions and helps on advanced topics.

\subsection pre_sec Prerequisite

QMCPACK can be installed on any Unix/Linux distribution with recent gnu
compilers (4.1 and higher). Other tested compilers are Intel compilers and IBM
VisualAge C++.  boost provides current status of C++ compilers. Please check
if your compiler can support boost/random library, which is the minimum
requirement to compile QMCPACK and associated packages.

In order to install QMCPACK, the users have to install cmake and several
required packages. These packages are included in the standard Linux/cygwin
distributions or can be downloaded by following the links. If these libraries
are installed in standard directories, /usr, /usr/local, no action
is necessary.  Alternatively, the users can set environment variables 
XYZ_HOME where XYZ stands for the name of package; the build utility
can locate the libraries and use them.

The build utility cmake will look for XYZ_HOME/include for the header
files and XYZ_HOME/lib for the library files in addition to the 
standard paths.  When multiple environment variables apply to a library, e.g., 
blas/lapack, the search is done according to the given  order.  On many HPC
centers, these packages are managed by utilities like module and
softenv. Consult the documentations on each site. 

\subsection cmake_sec Building using  cmake

For bash users,
-  Download the source code using subversion:

    <code>svn co http://cms.mcc.uiuc.edu/svn/qmcpack-dev/trunk qmcpack</code>
- Move to a build directory:

    <code>cd qmcpack/build</code>

- Set compilers and XYZ_HOME for the required external packages:

    <code>export CXX=g++</code>
    <code>export CC=gcc</code>

- Run cmake to create <c>Makefile</c>s:

    <code>cmake ..</code>

- Build everything:

    <code>make</code>
