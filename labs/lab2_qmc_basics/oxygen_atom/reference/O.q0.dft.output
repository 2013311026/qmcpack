     Parallel version (MPI), running on   512 processors
     R & G space division:  proc/pool =  512

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Reading input from O.q0.dft.in

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = LDA ( 1 1 0 0 0)
     EXX-fraction              =        0.00
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
