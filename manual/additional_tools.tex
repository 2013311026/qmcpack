\chapter{Additional Tools}
\label{chap:additional_tools}
In addition to Nexus, QMCPACK provides a set of light-weight executables which address certain
common problems in QMC workflow and analysis.  These range from conversion utilities between 
different file formats and QMCPACK (ppconvert and convert4qmc), HDF5 extraction utilities (extract-eshdf-kvectors), postprocessing utilities (trace-density and qmcfinitesize), and others.  They are all written in C++, and are built alongside QMCPACK.  They can be found in the build/bin directory.  In this chapter, we cover the use cases, syntax, and features of all additional tools provided with QMCPACK.
