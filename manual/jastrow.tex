\section{Jastrow Factors}
\label{sec:jastrow}

Jastrow factors are among the simplest and most effective ways of including
dynamical correlation in the trial many body wavefunction.  The resulting many body
wavefunction is expressed as the product of an antisymmetric (in the case
of Fermions) or symmetric (for Bosons) part and a correlating jastrow factor
like so:
\begin{equation}
\Psi(\vec{R}) = \mathcal{A}(\vec{R}) \exp\left[J(\vec{R})\right]
\end{equation}

In this section we will detail the types and forms of Jastrow factor used 
in QMCPACK. 

\section{One-body Jastrow functions}
\label{sec:onebodyjastrow}
The one-body Jastrow factor is a form that allows for the direct inclusion
of correlations between particles that are included in the wavefunction with
particles that are not explicitly part of it.  The most common example of
this are correlations between electrons and ions.  

The jastrow function is specified within a \texttt{wavefunction} element
and must contain one of more \texttt{correlation} elements specifying
additional parameters as well as the actual coefficients. Section
\ref{sec:1bjsplineexamples} gives examples of the typical nesting of
\texttt{jastrow}, \texttt{correlation}, and \texttt{coefficient} elements.

\end{tabular}
%\end{tabular*}
\end{center}
\end{table}

To be more concrete, the one-body jastrow factors used to describe correlations
between electrons and ions take the form below
\begin{equation}
J1=\sum_I^{ion0}\sum_i^e u_{ab}(|r_i-R_I|)
\end{equation}
where I runs over all of the ions in the calculation, i runs over the electrons
and $u_{ab}$ describes the functional form of the correlation between them.
Many different forms of $u_{ab}$ are implemented in QMCPACK.  We will detail 
two of the most common ones below.
