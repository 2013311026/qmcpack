\section{Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo}
\label{sec:afqmc}
Unlike diffusion Monte Carlo that works in first quantized representation and in configuration space, the auxiliary-field QMC (AFQMC) methods work in second quantized representation and in an auxiliary-field space to represent the wave function or density matrix and to carry out the integrations in evaluating ground-state properties. The idea of AFQMC is to constrain the phase of the overlap of the sampled Slater determinants with a trial wave function. It eliminates the phase instability and restores low-power ($N^3$) computational scaling. AFQMC applies Trotter approximation and Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation to obtain the propagator, which converts an interacting system into non-interacting systems in fluctuating external auxiliary-fields. The sum over all configurations of auxiliary fields recovers the interaction.

The input file has six basic xml-blocks: \texttt{AFQMCInfo}, \texttt{Hamiltonian}, \texttt{Wavefunction}, \texttt{WalkerSet}, \texttt{Propagator}, and \texttt{execute}.  The first five define input structures required for various types of calculations. The \texttt{execute} block represents actual calculations and takes as input the other blocks. 
Non-execution blocks are parsed first, followed by a second pass where execution blocks are parsed (and executed) in order. All blocks contain a ``name'' argument, which is used to identify the resulting block. For example, in the previous example, multiple Hamiltonian objects with different names can be defined. The one actually used in the calculation is the one passed to ``execute'' as ham.

Additional information:\\

\texttt{AFQMCInfo}: input block that defines basic information about the calculation. It is passed to all other input blocks to propagate the basic information:
\texttt{<AFQMCInfo name="info0">}
\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{NMO}. Number of molecular orbitals, i.e., number of states in the single particle basis. 
%\item \textbf{NAEA}. Number of Active Electrons-Alpha, i.e., number of spin-up electrons.
%\item \textbf{NAEB}. Number of Active Electrons-Beta, i.e., number of spin-down electrons.
\item \textbf{NCA}. number of core electrons of spin up (only meaningful if reading ascii FCIDUMPs). Default: 0.
\item \textbf{NCB}. Number of core electrons of spin down (only meaningful if reading ascii FCIDUMPs). Default: 0.\\
\end{itemize}

\texttt{Hamiltonian}: controls the object that reads, stores and manages the hamiltonian. 
  \texttt{<Hamiltonian name="ham0" type="SparseGeneral" info="info0">}
\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{filename}. Name of file with the \texttt{Hamiltonian}. This is a required parameter.
%\item \textbf{filetype}. The type of file found in filename. Options are: fcidump, hdf5. fcidump is the ascii based format of molpro, VASP, pyscf, etc.; hdf5 is the native hdf5-based format  of QMCPACK and can also be generated by modified versions of pyscf and VASP. This is a required parameter.
\item \textbf{cutoff\_1bar}. Cutoff applied to integrals during reading. Any term in the hamiltonian smaller than this value is set to zero. (For filetype=``hdf5'', the cutoff is only applied to the 2-electron integrals). Default: 1e-8
\item \textbf{cutoff\_decomposition}. Cutoff used to stop the iterative cycle in the generation of the Cholesky decomposition of the 2-electron integrals. The generation of Cholesky vectors is stopped when the maximum error in the diagonal reaches this value. In case of an eigenvalue factorization, this becomes the cutoff applied to the eigenvalues. Only eigenvalues above this value are kept. Default: 1e-6
\item \textbf{hdf\_write\_file}. If a value is given, an hdf5 restart file for the \texttt{Hamiltonian} is generated. Default: ``'' (no file is generated)
\item \textbf{hdf\_write\_type}. What to store in the restart file. Options: ``integrals'': write directly the 1- and 2-electron integrals; ``factorized'': write the cholesky decomposition of the integrals; ``default'': Default value, write the type found in filetype.
\item \textbf{ascii\_write\_file} If a value is given, an ascii restart file for the \texttt{Hamiltonian} is generated. Default: ``'' (no file is generated)
\item \textbf{nblocks}. This parameter controls the distribution of the 2-electron integrals among processors. In the default behavior (nblocks=1), all nodes contain the entire list of integrals. If nblocks $>$ 1, the of nodes in the calculation will be split in nblocks groups. Each node in a given group contains the same subset of integrals and subsequently operates on this subset during  any further operation that requires the hamiltonian. The maximum number of groups is NMO. Currently only works for filetype=``hdf5'' and the file must contain integrals.  Not yet implemented for input hamiltonians in the form of Cholesky vectors or for ascii input. Coming soon!
    Default: No distribution
\item \textbf{printEig}. If ``yes'', prints additional information during the Cholesky decomposition.
    Default: no
\item \textbf{fix\_2eint}.  If this is set to ``yes'', orbital pairs that are found not to be positive definite are ignored in the generation of the Cholesky factorization. This is necessary if the 2-electron integrals are not positive definite due to round-off errors in their generation.
    Default: no \\
\end{itemize}

\texttt{Wavefunction}: controls the object that manages the trial wave-functions. This block expects a list of xml-blocks defining actual trial-wave functions for various roles. 
\texttt{<Wavefunction name="wfn0" info="info0">}
  \texttt{<ImpSamp name="impsamp0" type="PureSD">}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{init}. Argument in ImpSamp. Selects pre-defined trial wave-functions if desired. 
Value: ground. Only for PureSD. Sets the trial wave-function to a block diagonal form. Diagonal in the occupied-occupied block and zero outside. This option corresponds to b
tate determinant (assuming orbitals ordered by increasing eigenvalue) in the orbital space that defines the hamiltonian. For a \texttt{Hamiltonian} generates based on HF orbitals, this generates a HF trial wave-function. (Only useful situation.)
\item \textbf{filename}. Name of file with wave-function information.
\item \textbf{cutoff}. cutoff applied to the terms in the calculation of the local energy. Only terms in the hamiltonian above this cutoff are included in the evaluation of the energy.
      Default: 1e-6
\item \textbf{nnodes}. Defines the parallelization of the local energy evaluation and the distribution of the \texttt{Hamiltonian} matrix (not to be confused with the list of 2-electron integrals managed by \texttt{Hamiltonian}. These are not the same.) If nnodes $>$ 1, the nodes in the simulation are split into groups of nnodes, each group works collectively in the evaluation of the local energy of their walkers. This helps distribute the effort involved in the evaluation of the local energy among the nodes in the group, but also distributes the memory associated with the wave-function among the nodes in the group.
      Default: No distribution
\item \textbf{hdf\_write\_file}. If provided, a restart file for the wave-function will be generated.
      Default: ``''
\item \textbf{runtype}. Unique to MultiPureSD with orthogonal expansions.
      Values: 0.  Use low memory algorithm. Much slower but has small memory requirements;
      1. Use high-memory algorithm. Faster but with significant memory requirements.
\item \textbf{fast}. Unique to MultiPureSD. If ``yes'', use fast-update algorithm with orthogonal expansions.
      Default: No
\item \textbf{Estimator}. Optional xml-block which defines a trial wave-function used for the calculation of energy averages.  It is used only during the collection of averages and doesn't influence the propagation. Note that this block must be set if an Estimator xml-block in the execute xml-block is specified. This must also be defined in order to calculate and print the energy in the case of hybrid propagation (see below). \\
\end{itemize}

\texttt{WalkerSet}: Controls the object that handles the set of walkers.
\texttt{<WalkerSet name="wset0" type="distributed">}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{pop\_control}. Population control algorithm. Options: ``simple'': Uses a simple branching scheme with a fluctuating population. Walkers with weight above max\_weight are split into multiple walkers of weight reset\_weight. Walkers with weight below min\_weight are killed with probability (weight/min\_weight); ``pair'': Fixed-population branching algorithm, based on QWalk's branching algorithm. Pairs of walkers with weight above/below max\_weight/min\_weight are combined into 2 walkers with weights equal to $(w_1+w_2)/2$. The probability of replicating walker w1 (larger weight) occurs with probability $w_1/(w_1+w_2)$, otherwise walker w2 (lower weight) is replicated; ``comb'': Fixed-population branching algorithm based on the Comb method. Will be available in the next release. Default: ``pair''
\item \textbf{min\_weight}. Weight at which walkers are possibly killed (with probability weight/min\_weight). Default: 0.05
\item \textbf{max\_weight}. Weight at which walkers are replicated. Default: 4.0
\item \textbf{reset\_weight}. Weight to which replicated walkers are reset to. Default: 1.0
\item \textbf{extra\_spaces}. Number of empty spaces kept in the list. Useful to avoid constant reallocation. Default: 10 \\
\end{itemize}

\texttt{Propagator}: Controls the object that manages the propagators.
\texttt{<Propagator name="prop0" info="info0">}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{cutoff}. Cutoff applied to Cholesky vectors. Elements of the Cholesky vectors below this value are set to zero.
    Default: 1e-6
\item \textbf{substractMF}. If ``yes'', apply mean-field substraction based on the ImpSamp trial wave-function. Must set to ``no'' to turn it off.
    Default: yes
\item \textbf{useCholesky}. If ``yes'', use iterative Cholesky decomposition to factorize 2-electron integral matrix. If ``no'', use eigenvalue decomposition (which is very slow and memory intensive).
    Default: yes
\item \textbf{vbias\_bound}. Upper bound applied to the vias potential. Components of the vias potential above this value are truncated there.
    Default: 3.0
\item \textbf{apply\_constrain}. If ``yes'', apply the phaseless constrain to the walker propagation. Currently, setting this to ``no'' produces unknown behavior, since free propagation algorithm has not been tested.
    Default: yes
\item \textbf{hybrid}. If ``yes'', use hybrid propagation algorithm. This propagation scheme doesn't use the local energy during propagation, leading to significant speed ups when its evaluation  cost is high. The local energy of the ImpSamp trial wave-function is never evaluated. To obtain energy estimates in this case, you must define an Estimator xml-block with the \texttt{Wavefunction} block. The local energy of this trial wave-function is evaluated and printed. It is possible to use a previously defined trial wave-function in the Estimator block, just set its ``name'' argument to the name of a previously defined wave-function. In this case, the same object is used for both roles.
    Default: no
\item \textbf{nnodes}. Controls the parallel propagation algorithm. If nnodes $>$ 1, the nodes in the simulation are split into groups of nnodes nodes, each group working collectively to propagate their walkers.
    Default: 1 (Serial algorithm)
\item \textbf{hdf\_read\_file}. If provided, initializes the object from the given file.
    Default: ``''
\item \textbf{hdf\_write\_file}. If provided, generates a restart file.
    Default: ``''
\item \textbf{parallel\_factorization}. If ``yes'', calculates Cholesky decomposition in parallel.
    Default: yes
\item \textbf{parallel\_propagation}. If ``yes'', uses parallel propagation algorithm even with nnodes=1. This is set to ``yes'' if nnodes $>$ 1. If ``no'', uses a serial propagation algorithm. Only possible if nnodes=1 and ncores=1 (in \texttt{execute} block).
    Default: yes
\item \textbf{dense}. If ``yes'', use a dense representation of the factorized hamiltonian. The default behavior uses a sparse representation. Which option is better depends on the sparsity of the problem.
    Default:  no \\
\end{itemize}

\texttt{execute}: Defines an execution region. 
\texttt{<execute wset="wset0" ham="ham0" wfn="wfn0" prop="prop0" info="info0">}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ortho}. number of steps between orthogonalization.
    Default: 1
\item \textbf{ncores}. Number of nodes in a task group. This number defines the number of cores on a node that share the parallel work associated with a distributed task. This number is used in the \texttt{Wavefunction} and \texttt{Propagator} task groups. The walker sets are shares by the ncores on a given node in the task group.
\item \textbf{checkpoint}. Number of blocks between checkpoint files are generated. If a value smaller than 1 is given, no file is generated. If \textbf{hdf\_write\_file} is not set, a default name is used. \textbf{Default: 0} 
\item \textbf{samplePeriod}. Number of blocks between sample collection. \textbf{Default: 0}
\item \textbf{hdf\_write\_file}. If set (and checkpoint>0), a checkpoint file with this name will be written.
\item \textbf{hdf\_read\_file}. If set, the simulation will be restarted from the given file.\\
\end{itemize}

Within the \texttt{Estimators} xml block has an argument \textbf{name}: the type of estimator we want to measure. Currently only ``basic'' or ``Basic'' or ``standard'' are allowed, , which are synonymous with one another. The basic estimator has the following optional parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{EstimEloc} or \textbf{estim\_eloc} or \textbf{estimeloc}. print the local energy of the ``Estimator'' wave-function. Default: false
\item \textbf{timers}. print timing information. Default: true
\item \textbf{nwalk}. print population control information ({\bf max \# branching events etc?}). Default: false \\
\end{itemize}

Recommended settings for large simulations:
\begin{itemize}
\item generate Cholesky-decomposed integrals from external code
\item use propagation hybrid algorithm: set steps/substeps to adequate values to reduce the number of energy evaluations
\item adjust cutoffs until desired accuracy is reached
\item adjust ncores to an efficient value \\
\end{itemize}
