k-space Jastrow test details
============================
The tests include short and long VMC runs for a primitive cell of 
diamond with a k-space Jastrow factor added to the short-ranged 
B-spline one used in other tests of this system.  The general form 
for the k-space Jastrow XML input was inferred by reading the source.
Starting with the optimized form of a J1 and J2 B-spline Jastrow, 
empty one- and two-body k-space Jastrow terms with a k-space cutoff of 
4.0 a.u. (resulting in 8 and 6 one- and two-body coefficients 
respectively) were added and optimized with version 3.1.1 of QMCPACK.  
Earlier versions, e.g. SVN revision 6259, produced only higher 
variances during optimization.  With correct optimization, a lowering 
in the energy and variance is observed over B-splines alone:

  VMC         Energy                  Variance               ratio
J12 B-spline -10.491929 +/- 0.001857  0.379176 +/- 0.006023  0.0361 
J12 k-space  -10.500884 +/- 0.001790  0.326804 +/- 0.015445  0.0311 

Reference data was generated with runs the same overall length 
(blocks x steps) as those included in ./qmc-ref, but using more blocks 
and fewer steps.  Using more blocks reduced the statistical error of 
the error bars, but resulted in output data files that were too large 
to include in the QMCPACK distribution.  The reference values and error 
bars were therefore computed from the higher block count runs.  The 
included reference runs were confirmed to be consistent with the original 
higher block count runs.  All reference data was generated with the SVN 
revision 6259 version of the code.

Reference data from the high block count VMC runs is found below:

             Energy                  Variance               ratio
qmc_kspace  -10.500719 +/- 0.000176  0.312264 +/- 0.002852  0.0297

For comparison, corresponding data for the lower block count VMC 
reference data found in ./qmc-ref is:

>qmca -e 2 -q ev qmc_kspace.s000.scalar.dat
             Energy                  Variance               ratio
qmc_kspace  -10.500721 +/- 0.000170  0.314640 +/- 0.001312  0.0300

Test input files were created by reducing the number of steps from the 
included reference by a factor of 10 for the "long" tests and by a 
further factor of 10 for the "short" tests.

Reference values for the mean local energy and variance were taken 
from the high block count reference runs.  Expected error bars were 
derived from the high block count data by multiplying the reference 
error bars by a factor of sqrt(10+1) and sqrt(100+1) for the long 
and short tests, respectively.  The factor of +1 accounts for the 
error bar intrinsic to the high block count runs.  

The target means and error bars for long and short tests are:

                 refmean     referr    longerr   shorterr
VMC J2 energy   -10.500719   0.000176  0.000584  0.001769
       variance   0.312264   0.002852  0.009459  0.028662

Error bars from typical long and short runs are shown below:

Typical long run results:

        Energy                  Variance               ratio
long   -10.500184 +/- 0.000530  0.319563 +/- 0.008351  0.0304

Typical short run results:

        Energy                  Variance               ratio
short  -10.500601 +/- 0.001779  0.308348 +/- 0.005698  0.0294

Rough timings for the tests on an old (circa 2013) AMD system are:

>grep 'Total Exe' *long*/*.out
long_test/qmc.out:  Total Execution time = 7.2162347854e+01 secs

>grep 'Total Exe' *short*/*.out
short_test/qmc.out:  Total Execution time = 1.4235623075e+01 secs
