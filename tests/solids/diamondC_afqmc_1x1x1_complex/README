These tests include short and long AFQMC runs for a two atom diamond
primitive cell at the gamma point. Tests exist for both the Cholesky
and ISDF factorization of the integrals. For the Cholesky factorization
there are tests for RHF, UHF and particle-hole multi-Slater determinant
(PHMSD) trial wavefunctions. For the ISDF factorization a RHF trial
wavefunction is used.
Reference data from the high block count AFQMC runs is found below:

Test input files were created by reducing the number of steps from the
included reference by a factor of 10 for the "long" tests and by a
further factor of 10 for the "short" tests.

A reference value for the mean local energy was taken from the high
block count reference run.  Expected error bars were derived from
the high block count data by multiplying the reference error bars by
a factor of sqrt(10+1) and sqrt(100+1) for the long and short tests,
respectively.  The factor of +1 accounts for the error bar intrinsic
to the high block count runs.

The target means and error bars for long and short tests are:
