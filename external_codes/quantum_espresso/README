The files in this directory support making a modified version of
quantum espresso that includes the pw2qmcpack converter.

If you have already downloaded quantum espresso you can, e.g.,

patch -p1 -i ../add_pw2qmcpack_to_espresso-5.2.1.diff

from within the top level quantum espresso directory.

Alternatively, the download_and_patch_qe5.2.1.sh script will
automatically download and patch quantum espresso. After patching you
can move the espresso directory anywhere convenient. There is no
need to keep it within the QMCPACK source tree. If you are
using NEXUS you should update your PATH so that the correct
executables are picked up.

Notes for maintainers:

1. Update the new version of QE. Hopefully the old patch
works. Typically there are small makefile updates and minor updates to
Module interfaces in read_file_lite

2. Create a new patch.

diff -urN espresso-5.2.1_original espresso-5.2.1_updated >add_pw2qmcpack_to_espresso-5.2.1.diff

3. Update the download_and_patch script. Version number and directory
location on QE Forge. The latter varies with no clear logic.

4. Check that QE patches and builds correctly using the download script.

5. Add the new patch and download script to SVN and commit.
