Parallelization / Distributed routines:

Finish:
1. Wave-function parallelization routines. Partition hamiltonian and write versions for MultiSD
2. 

Ideas to implement:
- Postprocessing driver. This will look over walkers saved in configuration files and calculate properties.
- Test and use idea where the projection is done with a large cutoff, but the energy is corrected by postprocessing configurations with a small cutoff. See how well it works.
- Implement version of energy and propagation routine where Spvn and Muv are stored as single precision real matrices. For chemical hamiltonians Spvn is purely complex and Muv is real, so no need to store these as complex. Apply complex factors as needed later. This should save a factor of 4 in memory.
- Finish GHF walkers

- implement a "meanfield_substraction" wave-function tag that can be used to calculate vMF in Propagator.
  test the dependence of the variance and bias on the quality of vMF for a fixed importancesampling twf
