-- right now the use of csr_matrix in cuda code is unsafe and generally difficult.
   To solve this, make a new csr_matrix-like class that looks like csr_matrix but that doesn't
   allow mutation/modification. This allows you to store things like nnz directly, since this class
   can't add/remove elements. Then pass nnz through the dispatching of csrmm and csrmv. This class 
   is memory owning.
